To follow tutorial steps you will need a code editor, a build tool, and `grpcurl` (a CLI for sending gRPC calls). You can use your preferred code editor. We provide the steps for using https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA {tab-icon}, window="tab"] from JetBrains. For the [.group-scala]#Scala# [.group-java]#Java# version of the example, we use [.group-scala]#`sbt`# [.group-java]#`Apache Maven`# as the build tool.

This tutorial uses Cassandra and Kafka. You may run local installations during development, but we recommend running both services using https://docs.docker.com[Docker {tab-icon}, window="tab"]. The template project's root directory includes a https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose] https://docs.docker.com/compose/[{tab-icon}, window="tab"] file that you can use to run Cassandra and Kafka. The provided Docker Compose file also runs Zookeeper which is required to run a Kafka broker.

The following sections provide links for downloading and installing:

* <<IntelliJ IDEA>>
* <<Build tool>>
* <<The grpcurl tool>>
* <<Docker and Docker Compose>>

We also provide downloadable versions of the example at different phases of completion. And, you will likely want to test locally before deploying to the cloud. You will need to understand how to configure to run locally. The following sections provide information on:

* <<Downloadable example source>>
* <<Configuring for local development>>

== IntelliJ IDEA

[.group-java]
Download and install https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ {tab-icon}, window="tab"].

[.group-scala]
To install IntelliJ and prepare to develop the Scala example, follow these steps:

[.group-scala]
. Download and install https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ {tab-icon}, window="tab"].
. From the *Preferences* menu, add the *Scala* plugin.


== Build tool

[.group-scala]
For the Scala Shopping Cart example, we use `sbt` as the build tool. https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html[Install sbt] if you haven't already.

[TIP.group-scala]
====
`sbt` is an interactive shell. If you start it with the `sbt` command, you can repeatedly run tasks like `compile` and `test` in the sbt shell. In the tutorial we use the full command for clarity, such as `sbt compile`. You can run tasks independently in this way, but it's faster to leave the `sbt` shell running and only enter the tasks. For example:

----
$ sbt
...
sbt:shopping-cart-service> compile
...
sbt:shopping-cart-service> test
...
----
====

[.group--java]
For the Java Shopping Cart example, we use `Maven` as the build tool. http://maven.apache.org/install.html[Install Maven] if you haven't already.

== The grpcurl tool

The https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl[grpcurl {tab-icon}, window="tab"] tool is useful for making gRPC calls from the command line. It is used in tutorial procedures and we recommend that you install it as described in https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl#installation[the grpcurl documentation {tab-icon}, window="tab"].

== Docker and Docker Compose
[#docker]

See the instructions for installing https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker {tab-icon}, window="new"] and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose {tab-icon}, window="tab"] on your platform. 

== Downloadable example source

We encourage entering the code described in the tutorial, even if you just copy and paste. If you get stuck or prefer to skip over some parts you can download a zip file containing the complete source code for each part of the tutorial.

ifdef::todo[TODO: download link]

ifdef::review[REVIEWERS: in the new UI template that we will have soon, each page will have a next and previous link with the full page title. The Learn More section can still appear but it makes sense for it not to include the next page.]

== Configuring for local development

By default, when using [.group-scala]#`sbt run`# [.group-java]#`mvn exec:exec`# the `Main` class will start an `ActorSystem` with the default `application.conf` which is the configuration intended to be used in production. When running locally you must override the configuration by using one the provided local configurations. Those local configuration properties are placed in the `local1.conf` file, and you can run the application with this configuration with:

[.group-java]
[source,shell script]
----
# make sure to compile before running exec:exec
mvn compile exec:exec -DAPP_CONFIG=local1.conf
----

[.group-scala]
[source,shell script]
----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local1.conf run
----

The `local1.conf` includes the `application.conf`. There are also `local2.conf`, `local3.conf`, and so on. Those define settings for additional Akka Cluster nodes. For example, a second node can be started with:

[.group-java]
[source,shell script]
----
# make sure to compile before running exec:exec
mvn compile exec:exec -DAPP_CONFIG=local2.conf
----

[.group-scala]
[source,shell script]
----
sbt -Dconfig.resource=local2.conf run
----

When you develop several services you have to adjust the port numbers in those files. Each node (`ActorSystem`) must use unique ports when running several on the same machine.


The example projects are using the following ports.

.shopping-cart-service ports

|Node |Akka Cluster |Akka Management HTTP |Akka gRPC

|local1.conf
|2551
